# Saving SuperStore
This was the fourth project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent
project designed to showcase what I have learned about Tableau Visualization. The purpose was to analyze the storeâ€™s
operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.

The project can be found [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler.f7184/viz/Sprint4Project_17183414422510/Part1_1)

### Process
* Analyzed financial data to evaluate profit and loss centers and assess the impact of returns on overall profitability
* Integrated multiple data sheets into a consolidated dataset, which served as the foundation for the analysis
* Conducted a thorough examination of how returns influenced profit margins and overall profitability
* Utilized various analytical techniques to quantify the impact of returns on profit and provided actionable insights to improve profitability
* Findings were documented and presented through detailed reports
