# E-Commerce Company: Business Analytics Report
This was the third project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project
designed to showcase what I have learned in business analytics. The purpose was to analyze the companies' raw transaction logs and
turn the event logs into business metrics.

### Process
I first explored, filtered, and cleaned the data. Then I created and built a conversion funnel. I prepared data for cohort analysis.
Calculated retention rates. Lastly, I finalized formatting and documentation for the client's readability.
