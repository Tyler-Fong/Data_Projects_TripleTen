# Zomato Restaurant Analysis
This was the seventh project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent
project designed to showcase all the skills I have learned over the course. The purpose was to analyze the company's data on restaurants and
form data-driven recommendations to optimize revenue.

### Process
* Cleaned the data by checking for duplicates, standardizing formats, removing irrelevant columns, and converting all sales amounts to USD
* Formed research questions and hypotheses to test for
* Uploaded data onto Tableau and joined three different tables together for analysis
* Created five visualizations to look for patterns, trends, and insights
* The findings were documented and presented through detailed reports
