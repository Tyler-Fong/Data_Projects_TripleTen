# NYC Airbnb: Vacation Rental Market Analysis
This was the first project I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase
what I have learned about Advanced Spreadsheets. This project is about analyzing Airbnb listings in Manhattan, NYC to help a client decide what type
of vacation rental property to invest in.

The Google spreadsheet can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HRxnenVu_R43z-buOjeMcrUXT6qf4u3gSbUH5YvUp3I/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook)

### Process
* Analyzed property data to make strategic targeting and revenue forecasting
* Filtered and cleaned large datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis
* Created detailed aggregations and pivot tables to identify the most promising types of properties for investment opportunities
* Performed in-depth calculations to assess current occupancy rates and estimate potential revenue streams based on various scenarios
* The insights gained from this analysis facilitated data-driven decision-making and contributed to the formulation of effective property investment strategies
